# navigation
## This will include all required navigating and determine how to reduce power for each best pathing determined

# To Do:
## Update to obtain actual GPS coordinates of turtle and vehicle
## Update to use Ardupilot and determine pathing around obstacles and avoid preset boundaries
## Update to correctly maneuver as preset speeds and to keep power usage low, specifically when in area of turtle
## Determine logic to find the angle in which direction the vehicle is pointing

# Current Capabilities
## Given an angle the vehicle is facing and GPS coordinates of turtle and vehicle, outputs the smallest rotation by either rotating clockwise or counter clockwise
